## Description 

In this project, we aim to accurately detect vehicles
in drone-captured images using various computer vision
models. To accomplish this, we utilize the VisDrone2019
dataset, which consists of annotated images and videos captured
by drones in different locations, environments, and
weather conditions. We evaluate the performance of several
popular models, including Faster RCNN, Mask
RCNN, Single Shot Detector (SSD), Yolo 3, Yolo 5, and Yolo
8, and compare their results. Our findings provide insights
into the effectiveness of different models for vehicle detection
in drone imagery.

##Result
| Algorithm                 | mAP@0.5 | Inference Time (ms) |
|---------------------------|---------|---------------------|
| SSD                       | 0.12    | 30                  |

| Faster-RCNN (Resnet50-FPN)| 0.27    | 170                 |
| Mask-RCNN                 | 0.29    | 200                 |

| Yolo-v5-Small             | 0.46    | 6.4                 |
| Yolo-v5-Extra-Large       | 0.54    | 12.1                |
| Yolo-v8-Small             | 0.46    | 1.20                |
| **Yolo-v8-Extra-Large**       | **0.56**    | **3.53**                |


## Conclusion 
In conclusion, we compared several object detection models using the mean average precision (mAP) metric at a threshold of 0.5 and inference time (FPS). The YOLO-v8 Extra-Large model achieved the highest mAP score of 0.56, while the YOLO-v8 Small model had the fastest inference time of 1.20 milliseconds. However, it's important to consider the trade-off between accuracy and speed when selecting a model for a specific use case.
